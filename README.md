# Wish Doge Dragon

"I am Wish Doge Dragon. I have not been summoned from the tea pot for 10,000 years! How my name became so popular in the 21st century is still a surprise to me. I am here to grant you 3 wishes” said the Dragon.

## Story

This is a story about a young good hearted crypto trader named Dintoshi Songkamoto who was tired of not making real money from all the newly listed Defi projects. One day Dintoshi stumbled upon a magic teapot. When he touched it, out came a magic dragon named Doge.

"I am Wish Doge Dragon. I have not been summoned from the tea pot for 10,000 years! How my name became so popular in the 21st century is still a surprise to me. I am here to grant you 3 wishes” said the Dragon.

Dintoshi responded, “Wish Doge Dragon, can you please create a token to benefit all of crypto-kind.”

Doge said, the perfect token will cost you 3 wishes:
1. Gifts of riches - 8%
A 8% Redistribution to all holders via BNB for true believers.  
2. Liquidity.  
3% of all transaction gets transformed into liquidity. 
3. Diamond Hand incentives.  
An additional 3% taxes to all sellers and a limit of 0.1% of anti-whales’ dumping. 

But you, Dintoshi, must gather a community to work on letting the world know about this perfect token. And for that, I will grant you 3% on buy and 5% on sell for your efforts.

May you earn fortunes into eternity, said Wish Doge Dragon as he created this coin and went back into the pot for another 10,000 years.
